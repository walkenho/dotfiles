# dotfiles
A collection of my config files. 

I used to store my configuration files as part of my notes. However, I recently stumbled across other people having dedicated repositories for these type of files (particularly the first in the list below) and liked the idea, so here I am, [stealing like an artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_Like_an_Artist) :)

## Structure
* `/dotfiles` - contains hidden files that normally live in the `$HOME` directory (`.bashrc`, etc). 

## Similar Work
For further inspiration, check out these repositories:
